 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Samuel's Tech Journey</h3></summary>
   My journey started as a wedding filmmaker, where I learned how to tell compelling visual stories. However, I wanted to explore my passion for technology and creativity further, so I enrolled in a national institution for information and technology to study software development. There, I learned how to use tools like SQL, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and various frameworks to create innovative software solutions.

After completing my studies, I progressed into making commercials and festival promotional content, applying my newfound software development skills to create engaging visuals that conveyed a message effectively. Along the way, I earned a Professional Diploma in Directing for Filmmaking from Delyork Creative Academy, and my films received critical acclaim at several film festivals.

Driven by my passion for technology, I continued my education by getting certified from Harvard in Computer Science (CS50). Now, I aim to create value by combining my expertise in software development and filmmaking to develop innovative solutions that are both user-friendly and technologically advanced.

Through my GitHub projects, I hope to showcase my skills and contribute to the vibrant community of developers and creatives. Whether it's collaborating on exciting new projects or helping others achieve their goals, I look forward to sharing my journey and making a positive impact.
